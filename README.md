# Todo

- Dependency chaos:
  - Draw all modules and their dependencies and think about them.
  - Should cards have a game attribute which they use to query the world (e.g., who the
    opposing agent is) and to update the world (instead of the view directly)?
- Write tests for all existing classes and all card characteristics and sigils.
- Rename sigil to ink, seal, skill, mark, finesse, talent, special, ...?
