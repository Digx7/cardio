# Next up

- Get rid of non-exact potencies.

- Bug-like: The potency that is used to for computer cards should maybe ignore the
  costs. Otherwise, a card like muddark has too low potency I think. (Keep in mind that
  the bluprint catalog has a special data structure for potencies that might need to be
  adjusted.)
  - Should potency be it's own class that can encapsulate raw, normalized and
    computer/net variants?

- Bug: Aborting card placement with ESC will lead to a card flash like an error.

- CHECK: Are lives handled correctly? If I have several lives, can I continue a run
  after losing a live?

- Add more skills.
- Scoring and difficulty progress:
  - Should there be additional scores in addition to the rung? Something that better
    reflects the difficulty mastered by that run? E.g., number of fights? Or should
    there be a score per fight (maybe something that reflects how hard the fight is)?
  - Refine FightLocation and Computerstrategy so the game becomes harder and harder as
    the rungs increase.
  - Use card generator to this end.
- Add stats to game state: number of fights won, locations visited, number and which
  cards defeated, which cards confronted with, ... -- could have an instance of each
  "thing" (card, location, etc.) and log the stats with these things (using a special
  Stats class that gets added to each such thing) -- or maybe just the entire run in
  some useful format? (Would replace log and maybe also the stateslogger) -- Keep in
  mind that some cards can die during a run but should still keep their stats available.
  How to do that exactly?
  - And history to runs, and all histories need to be saved.
- Smooth "state" changes such as map -> fight, fight won / fight -> map, game over, ...
- Resolve the shield deadlock and general deadlock issue. Cf. `_has_computer_won` in
  fightvnc.
- Add deadlock resolver.
  - Shields introduce deadlocks.
  - See also notes in FightVnC.
- Maybe destroy likelihood in UPU etc should also rise with
  amount of Power/Health a card has already?


# Architectural considerations

- Rethink how the session module works. Maybe get rid of it? Maybe have a common way
  tests get set up in a central test module and a way sandbox.py sets up the game and
  get rid of session altogether? -- But would need some module that grants access to
  view to Card class.
  - Sometimes, we inject links to the model to an object (e.g., to grid) and sometimes
    we don't (e.g., humanagent and computeragent in FightVnC). -> Better make this
    consistent?
  - One approach could be: Always use the session. But no code whatsoever in the
    session. Everything gets set up outside of session and gets injected into the
    session module.
- Dependency chaos?
  - Draw all modules and their dependencies and think about them.
  - Should cards have a game attribute which they use to query the world (e.g., who the
    opposing agent is) and to update the world (instead of the view directly)?
- MVC: Could I have the basic FightVnC, which takes a Controller object, that does the
  playcard stuff etc. and an Animator object that makes all the animations available
  that are necessary?
  - QQ: How many of the controller-related functions in FightVnC are actually
    subclassed? How much subclassing is necessary there?
  - How many methods could really be moved to the Animator class? I.e., how many methods
    use information from the model?
  - Is the differentiation between methods that have r/o access to the model and ones
    that have r/w access?


# Todo

- QQ: Spirits: keep them between fights (as it is now)? (Maybe have to sacrifice 1 life
  if you want to keep them?)
- QQ: Should there be maximums for power, health, costs_*, and has_* and the number of
  skills a card can have? If so, those should be introduced and enforced. -- Note: There
  are at least implicit maxima now with the introduction of the potency range (see
  Card.MAX_*).
- Check for right minimum resolution at the beginning.
- Terminology: agent vs player everywhere? Which is the better term? Make it consistent.
  -- Or: Terminology: Player 1 or H and Player C?
- Edge case: What if the grid is empty or powerless at some point during a fight? Who
  will win?
- Reduce the number of places the session module gets imported to a sensible minimum.
- Turn all the notes here and in DOMAIN into a Github wiki.
- Check TUI on linux / wsl.
- Add titles to locations.


# More animations

- When an agent loses a health bar.
- Animate overflow damage that turns into gems.
- More animations for certain skills?

# Ideas: All prios

- Location ideas:
  - Card shop: Buy cards for gems
  - Exchange: Change spirits to gems and vice versa
  - Card lottery: Give a card and get a random card in return
  - Card/skill game: Play some little game and the better you are the better the card
    you get (at random) in return. Or the better a skill you can chose? Or the more
    random skills or cards you can choose from. Or... -- Ideas for minigames:
    - Guess the number: The computer picks a number between 1 and 100 and you have to
      guess it. The computer tells you whether your guess is too high or too low.
    - Rock Paper Scissors for x times.
    - Perform calculations ever quicker.
    - Keep up with typing text that gets produced ever faster.
    - Press keys as they appear on screen as quickly as possible.
    - Snakes/Tron
    - Frogger
  - Card buyer: Buy certain cards for gems -- usually higher value cards
  - Card disposer: Allows you to get rid of cards (just 1 maybe) at a cost in gems
  - Card merger: Merge 2 identical cards for double attributes (or, if you don't have
    any pairs, duplicate a card)
  - Card cost mutator: Switch card costs from fire to (many more) spirits and vice
    versa.
  - Locations around items...? Item shop, ...?
  - Treasure location? âœ˜âœ˜âœ˜ -- Pick one of several digging locations and get a random
    item in return (or nothing).
  - Have a location that allows me to create new cards, combining health, power and
    skills, and give them a name and keep them. -- Or some other mechanism to create new
    cards?
  - Location where I can name a card in my deck? (Or possibility to name a new card when
    I get one in one of the other locations?)
  - Location where the player can pick another card from his collection to add to his
    deck?
- Items? -- Item ideas: E.g., rucksack ðŸŽ’, bigger rucksack ðŸŽ’ðŸŽ’, some item that allows
  me to keep my leftover spirits between fights but that I can also spend to get
  one-time somethingsomething.
- Display some help output in the lower right corner? Current state of the app, allowed
  keys, unrecognized keys, ...?
- Check out performance of animations: Esp. when running on battery power. -> Add some
  setting that helps speed up / slow down the animations. Then do some self-timing e.g.
  on burning a card that will automatically adjust that setting if necessary (i.e.,
  animation takes too long or too short).
- could cards gain experience with fights and other things and evolve over time (stats
  would be permanent) but also die for real?
- Terrain and weather conditions etc. that affect the cards?
- Maybe you can lose cards for good in a run -- in a fight? Or as a downside risk when
  going for a particularly strong upgrade? E.g., the stronger the upgrade the higher the
  likelihood to lose the card? -- Then, a save game and game progress score would
  somehow take into account a hash over the entire game to make sure the game has not
  been tampered with? Then only authoritative scores are allowed in leaderboards etc.
  Can the TSE be used somehow to that end? Or some authoritative docker images with the
  software? Of course one option is always to deploy on the web and run it centralized.
  (Yet another option might be to create logs of information with each run (including
  all user choices) that can be used to simulate and verify the run. That way, it can be
  verified if such a run relly exists. (Such a system would still be prone to cheating
  by creating a computer agent that brute force searches for the best run.)) (Maybe this
  could be combined with the code taking a hash over its entire code and game state to
  proof originality of code at a certain point in time? Maybe also combined with some
  proof of humanity (the minigames?) to prevent bots from playing the game?)
- Have floor tiles with special effects? I.e., more strength if a create is on it?
- Can there be shops where you can buy stuff, including additional lives?
- Maybe spirits could be persistent and can be taken over to the next fight?
- Explain locations in the map view? Or have some keystroke that opens explanatory text
  in any view?
- Have some generic animation (just some color change for 0.2 seconds?) for skill
  effects that get activated. E.g., for shield.
- Make fire effect work on WSL.


# Low Prio Ideas

- Instead of picking random cards from the player's collection to compile the deck,
  maybe the player can choose which cards from her collection to start a run with.
  Choosing could be based on a pure number of cards basis. Or based on points (and maybe
  also gems and spirits). Or based on a combination of both.
- Some kind of main menu?
  - Add a way to create a new game.
  - Add a way to set a player name when a new game gets created.
  - Add a way to set a seed.
- Add a quick "FIGHT!" splash screen before a fight? (Maybe after the initial grid has
  been set up?)
- Maybe NoLocations can have minor "on the way" events? I.e., gain/lose some gems, ...?
- Hidden locations? I.e., locations that are not revealed until you visit them.
- Randomize player's start cards at the beginning of a run from a set of possible start
  cards.
- For convenience: Placement cursor could pick the first slot that makes sense for the
  current card, i.e., the first empty slot for cards with `costs_fire == 0`.
- Don't show costs in computer cards.
- Different tribes?
- If there are more and more cards, maybe they get some meta information around
  curation, likes, etc.?
- Achievements/badges for the player?
- Upgrading the game should invalidate all running/saved runs.
- Can we add the new fire and spirits placement logic to the hypo-driven tests? Maybe
  using the placement mgr in the hypo test?
- Use asciimatics' arrow as an avatar for the human player? (Or the computer?)


# Debugging hints

- Call `start_debug_mode` at spots in the code where you'd like to inspect variables
  during execution.
- Call `print(self.stateslogger.create_event())` when debugging the fight controller
  using pdb to show the current state of the game.

# Asciimatics

- Double buffering: Newly drawn stuff gets drawn to the buffer. A call to
  `screen.refresh()` will display the newly drawn stuff on screen. To clear the screen,
  use `clear_buffer` instead of the simple `clear` to prevent flickering.
- Simple rendering: https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics/blob/master/samples/rendering.py

- Use bars for scores or other stuff? https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics/blob/master/samples/bars.py
- Use fireworks when won. 
  - Maybe small explosions when a player is hit? Or fireworks, bc they also show where the hit is coming from?
  - https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics/blob/master/samples/particles.py

# Fonts

- Hack NF works well.
- Is there a Consolas NF variant?
