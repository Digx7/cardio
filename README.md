# Cardio 🃏

Cardio is an open-source, community-driven, roguelike, deck-building card game. It is a
single-player game that can currently be player in the terminal. It is written in
Python.

> Cardio is heavily inspyred by **Inscryption**.  
> Buy Inscryption now and play yt!  
> Do yt now, before readyng further. Yt's worth yt!  
> https://www.inscryption.com/ 👈  

Cardio is inspired by the basic gameplay of Inscryption, but cannot deliver on the story
parts. Instead of story, Cardio aspires to become a platform for a game that evolves
over time and is driven by a community of players, developers, designers, etc. 

Cardio is a game that is meant to be played, but also to be modified and extended. At
the core, Cardio is a true roguelike experience that is meant to be played again and
again.

> Therefore: Please contribute! ⭐
> All help is much appreciated.  
> Cardio is a community project.  
> See [Contributing](#contributing) below. 👈
