    Principles for `has_*` and `costs_*`:
    - `costs_fire` & `costs_spirits`:
        - Exactly one is > 0.
    - `has_fire` & `has_spirits`:
        - Typically both are == 1.
        - Max one is > 1.
        - Neither is == 0, "0-ness" is indicated via some skill such as bloodless or
          inert or so. (A card with bloodless should always have both `has_*` == 1.)
        - The preceding two bullets are design decisions to keep things simple(r) so a
          player can rely on default information even if not all information is always
          displayed.
        - (QQ: Possible variant: `has_spirits` is always == 1; this would simplify
          things further. But the current philosophy could easily be adapted to such a
          rule.)

    QQ: Turn `has_*` and `costs_*` into properties to enforce the above rules?
