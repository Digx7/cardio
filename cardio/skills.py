"""Skills

Checklist when adding a new skill:

- Implement its logic. There are 3 implenetation styles:
  - Fully self-contained ‚≠ê: The skill is implemented in its own class and only uses
    hooks from the base class `Skill`. Example: Regenerate. -- This is the preferred
    style.
  - Fully dependent: The skill is implemented with specific code in `FightCard` and/or
    `FightVnC`. The skill class serves only as a container for the skill's basic
    attributes. Examples: InstantDeath, Fertility, Spines, Soaring, Airdefense.
  - Hybrid: The skill uses specific code outside its class but also some logic in the
    class (as well as maybe some state to be tracked). Examples: LuckyStrike, Shield,
    Weakness. 
- Check for possible interdependencies with other skills and address those in the code
  accordingly.
- Add tests for skill and all interdependencies.
- Does the skill add any kind of state to the card (or other cards or other parts of the
  world) that would need to be set or reset in any of the hooks (e.g., `pre_attack`
  etc.)?
- Any new hooks needed? (E.g., because the skill needs to be (re)set at other points in
  time such as before or after preparing a card.)
- Does the skill need any new view animation that needs to be implemented and called?
- Anything that needs to be saved in the game state (i.e., module `jason`)?
- Create new blueprints with this skill and add them to the catalog. (Use the
  `fix_skill` variable in `gen_skills`. Generate an amount of blueprints with that skill
  that is reasonable in the overall catalog, cf `blueprint_stats.ipynb`.)
