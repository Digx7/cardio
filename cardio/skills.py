"""Skills

Checklist when adding a new skill:
- Implement its logic in `Card` (and elsewhere, if necessary).
- Check for possible interdependencies with other skills and address those in the code
  accordingly.
- Add tests for skill and all interdependencies.
- Does the skill add any kind of state to the card (or other cards or other parts of the
  world) that would need to be reset (e.g., in `Card.reset`)?
- Does the skill need any new view animation that needs to be implemented and called?
- Anything that needs to be saved?

# ----- Ideas for more skills ----- High prio -----


# ----- Ideas for more skills ----- Medium prio -----

# - Overrun üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è -- A card with Overrun will apply surplus damage to the prep line card
#   instead of the opposing player. (Caveat: This would have no effect for computer
#   player cards.)
# - Longrange üèπ -- A card with Longrange will attack the prep line card instead of the
#   front line card. (Caveat: Makes only sense for human player's cards.)
# - Rampage -- A card with Rampage will become stronger with every opponent it kills.
# - Confused üòµ -- A card with Confused will occasionally attack its own allies instead
#   of the opponent.
# - Pregnant -- One-time (per fight) fertility?
# - Firefighter üöíüßØüßë‚Äçüöí -- A card with Firefighter will reduce its neighbors' fire to
#   0.
# - Parry -- A card with Parry has a chance to deflect an opponent's attack back at
#   them.
# - Drain üíâ -- A card with Drain can steal health from an opponent's cards.
# - Eternal / Persistent / Resilient -- A card with Persistent will be returned to its
#   owner's deck when it dies.
# - Echolot üîç -- Pick a specific card from the deck.
# - Summon ü§ù -- A card with Summon can bring other cards from your deck into play.
# - Yell üó£Ô∏è -- A card with Yell will deal 1 more damage when it attacks.
# - Poisonous üêçüíä / Noxious üåø -- Opponent (player or card?) gets poisoned and loses 1
#   health each round.
# - Radiant üåû -- A card with Radiant creates 1 more spirit each time it gets brought
#   into play.
# - Glutton üçî or Insatiable üçï -- A card with Glutton becomes 1 unit more costly each
#   time it gets brought into play.
# - Slow üê¢ -- A card with Slow will attack only every other round.
# - Slow II -- A card with Slow II will attack at the end of the round instead of at its
#   usual turn. (Can be both an advantage or a disadvantage for the human.)
# - Stun ü•ä -- A card with Stun will stun an attacked card with a successful attack. A
#   stunned card will not attack next round.
# - Leader üëë -- A card with Leader can buff other cards.
# - Recruit üë• -- Recruit one of the opponent's cards that you killed at the end of the
#   fight.
# - Terminator ü§ñ -- Destroys a card for good. Not just for this fight but for the
#   entire game. (Only makes sense against the human player maybe?)


# ----- Ideas for more skills ----- Low prio -----
# (Low prio and/or high complexity and/or only applicable to human's cards)

# - Corbeaux / Corvus Corax -- Can consume spirits and release them as fire.
# - Viral -- Like poisonous, but spreads?
# - Crazy -‚Äì A card with Crazy randomly attacks either the opponent's cards or the
#   player's own cards, creating unpredictable and potentially chaotic gameplay.
# - Wildcard üÉè -- In each round, gets a random skill from the list of all skills.
# - Blowfish üí£ -- A card with Blowfish can explode, dealing damage to opponent and its
#   2 neighbors. Or to opponent and its prep line. But then it dies.
# - Confuse üòµ -- A card with Confuse can confuse an opponent's cards, causing them to
#   attack each other.
# - Hunter / Kidnapper -- A card with Hunter will grab the opposing card to the player's
#   side (for the duration of the fight), pushing the Hunter-card to the prep line
#   (computer) or the player's (human) hand.
# - Bloodsucker ü©∏ -- A card with Bloodsucker will have comparatively high fire cost but
#   can use opponent's cards as well for sacrifice.
# - "Allesfresser" -- can use fire _or_ spirit (or a mix) to be placed.
# - Hotblooded -- Can be played at any time. (Doesn't really fit the basic gameplay
#   model but might be a fun "real-time" element where you either press a key in time to
#   interrupt the game flow or you missed it.)
# - Wither üíÄ -- A card with Wither deals damage to itself at the end of each turn. (Too
#   similar to Overload?)
